## Three observations about this data:
1) Final tumor volume was lowest with the drugs Capomulin and Ramiane - these two drugs should be investigated further. The drugs Infubinol and Ceftamin should not be investigated further as they did nothing to shrink tumor growth.

2) The correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume is .84. This is a fairly strong positive relation and indicates that a healthy diet and exercise may prevent tumors from growing.

3) Mouse m601 had a particularly good treatment outcome with the drug Capomulin. His tumor volume shrank from 45.0 mm3 to 28.4 mm3.
